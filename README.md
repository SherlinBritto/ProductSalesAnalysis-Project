Problem Definition:
REC corp LTD. is a small-scaled business venture in India that has been selling four products for over ten years. They have collected sales data from their retail centers and organized it into a CSV file. They need help analyzing this data to answer the following questions:
1.	Is there any trend in the sales of all four products during certain months?
2.	Out of all four products, which product has seen the highest sales in all the given years?
3.	The company has all its retail centers closed on the 31st of December every year. Mr: Hariharan, the CEO, would love to get an estimate on the number of units of each product that could be sold on the 31st of December, every year, if all their retail centers were kept open.
4.	The CEO is considering an idea to drop the production of any one of the products. He wants you to analyze the data and suggest whether his idea would result in a massive setback for the company.
5.	The CEO would also like to predict the sales and revenues for the year 2024. He wants you to give a yearly estimate with the best possible accuracy.
